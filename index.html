        Introduction to Java. JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.

          What is Java technology and why do I need it? Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.

        Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

      To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
      first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      <code
        >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
      </code>

      Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your

        Unlike C/C++, there are no standard global variables in java but you can still define global variables that can be used across all classes. Global variables are those variables that can be accessed across all the classes. Java does not support global variables explicitly, you need to create a class and global variables can be part of this class.

       Computer Science. A constant is a variable whose value cannot change once it has been assigned. Java doesn't have built-in support for constants, but the variable modifiers static and final can be used to effectively create one. Constants can make your program more easily read and understood by others.

    <header>Data types</header>
    <article>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>
              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
              other variant.
            </li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>
              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
              unique and immutable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
      to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
      are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
      objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
      your application can perform.

    <header>if...else statement</header>
    <article>
      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
      true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
      is false. An if statement looks as follows:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
      condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
      statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
      including further nested if statements.
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <code
        >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
      </code>
      In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
      evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
      them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
      to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

      <code
        >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
      >
      It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
      because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
      the code. For example, do not use the following code:
      <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
      assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
      additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

      <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
      evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

      <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
      statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
      statement following the loop.

      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>

      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
        those statements.
      </p>

      Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
        true, so the loop terminates.
      </p>
